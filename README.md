# inventorgg/compare
This repository hosts a comprehensive comparison of the features of Discord bot hosting services across different plans. We ([inventor.gg](https://inventor.gg)) use this list to generate [comparison pages](https://inventor.gg/compare) on our marketing site.

## Why?
When companies compare themselves to competitors, those comparisons are often one-sided with cherry-picked data. We wanted our website to offer an honest comparison, so we have open-sourced the configuration file that generates our comparison pages, and welcome contributions from the community.

## Bot Makers
This list currently compares the following bot makers:

- inventor.gg
- botwiz.dev
- botghost.com

We are currently only planning on including bot makers that are cloud-based and fully-featured (including hosting). We may expand to other types of bot makers in the future.

## Contributing
If you notice something inaccurate here, or believe we should be tracking a new metric, please submit a pull request (the yaml file is easy to edit with GitHub's web editor).

We also accept PRs for new bot maker products. Please keep in mind that such PRs should also update this list in the README.

Updates to this repo can take a while to be reflected on the Inventor site comparison pages.

## Usage
This comparison file is open source under the MIT License. Other websites, bot makers, etc are welcome to use this list or build upon it for any purpose.

With that said, this list is designed to be used for comparison pages, and as a result we limit the bot makers included in the list, only track certain attributes, and may not approve PRs that drastically increase the maintenance required for the list.

The code and templates used to generate Inventor's comparison pages is not open source.
